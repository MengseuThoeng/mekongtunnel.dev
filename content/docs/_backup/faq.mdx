# FAQ

## General

### Is MekongTunnel free?

Yes. The public hosted instance at `mekongtunnel.dev` is free to use. The server code is MIT licensed — you can also self-host for free.

### Do I need to create an account?

No. There is no account system. Connect and get a URL immediately.

### How is this different from ngrok?

| | MekongTunnel | ngrok |
|--|--|--|
| Open source | ✅ MIT | ❌ Proprietary |
| Account required | ❌ None | ✅ Required |
| Self-hostable | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Custom domains | ✅ (self-hosted) | 💲 Paid plan |
| Protocol | Standard SSH | Proprietary |

### What protocols are supported?

HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket. Raw TCP tunneling is not currently supported.

## Troubleshooting

### "No output / connection hangs"

The `-t` flag is required when using raw SSH. Without it, no TTY is allocated and the server cannot display the URL:

```bash
# Wrong — hangs
ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 mekongtunnel.dev

# Correct
ssh -t -R 80:localhost:8080 mekongtunnel.dev
```

The `mekong` CLI handles this automatically.

### "Host key verification failed"

Accept the host key on first connection:

```
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
```

Or add `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` (not recommended for production).

### "Connection refused on port 22"

```bash
# Check that the service is running
docker compose ps

# Check ports are open
sudo ss -tlnp | grep -E ':(22|80|443)'
sudo ufw status
```

### "Certificate issues"

```bash
sudo certbot renew
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/*.pem data/certs/
docker compose restart
```

### "Rate limit exceeded"

You've created more than 3 tunnels from your IP, or made more than 10 new connections per minute. Wait a minute and try again.

If you need higher limits, [self-host](/docs/self-hosting) and adjust the constants in `internal/config/config.go`.

### "IP is temporarily blocked"

Repeated rate-limit violations trigger a 1-hour IP block. Wait for the block to expire (the error message shows the remaining time).

## Self-Hosting

### Do I need a wildcard TLS certificate?

Yes. Without a wildcard cert (`*.yourdomain.com`), the browser will show a certificate error for tunnel subdomains. Let's Encrypt issues wildcard certs for free via DNS challenge.

### Can I run multiple instances?

Yes. Use different ports for each instance. See the [Configuration](/docs/configuration) docs.

### How do I update?

```bash
git pull
make build-small
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

## Technical

### What is the subdomain format?

Subdomains are generated as `adjective-noun-hex8` (e.g. `happy-tiger-a1b2c3d4`). They are memorable, unique, and URL-safe.

### Can I request a specific subdomain?

Not currently. A random subdomain is assigned on each connection. This means the URL changes on every reconnect. Custom subdomain reservation is a planned feature.

### Is WebSocket compression supported?

Not currently. WebSocket frames are proxied as-is without compression negotiation.

### Where is the request log stored?

It is streamed to your SSH terminal in real time. It is not persisted to disk. When the SSH session ends, the log is lost.
