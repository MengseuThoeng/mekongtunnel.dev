# Getting Started

MekongTunnel is a **self-hosted SSH tunnel server** written in Go. It works like ngrok or Cloudflare Tunnel, but you control it.

Run one command and expose any local port to the internet with a public HTTPS URL:

```
mekong 3000
```

You get:
- A unique public URL: `https://happy-tiger-a1b2.mekongtunnel.dev`
- The URL copied to your clipboard automatically
- A QR code printed in your terminal
- Live HTTP request logs streamed to your terminal
- Auto-reconnect if the connection drops

## Prerequisites

- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- A running local service on any port

That's it. No account. No config file. No dashboard.

## Quick start

**Step 1** — Install the CLI

```bash
sudo curl -L https://github.com/MuyleangIng/MekongTunnel/releases/download/v1.0.0/mekong-darwin-arm64 -o /usr/local/bin/mekong
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mekong
```

See the [Installation](/docs/installation) page for all platforms.

**Step 2** — Start a local server (or use your existing app)

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

**Step 3** — Open a tunnel

```bash
mekong 3000
```

You'll see the banner with your public URL within seconds.

## What happens under the hood

When you run `mekong 3000`, the CLI:

1. Connects to `mekongtunnel.dev` over SSH on port 22
2. Sends a `tcpip-forward` request to ask the server to forward traffic
3. The server assigns you a memorable subdomain and starts listening
4. A public HTTPS URL is displayed in your terminal
5. Incoming requests are forwarded to your `localhost:3000` via the SSH channel

See [How It Works](/docs/how-it-works) for a full technical walkthrough.
